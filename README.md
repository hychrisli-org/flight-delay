# Flight Delay Predictor

Team project to build a flight delay predication web application, using React, Flask, scikit-learn, and MySQL. Our prediction models were trained on historical flight delay and weather data, which were correlated by airports' geographic coordinates. We used K-means to cluster airports with similar features to improve the model accuracy, and then trained our classification models using random forests and Xgboost.
